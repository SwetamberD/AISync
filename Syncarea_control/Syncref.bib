  abstract={A coupled Hamiltonian system of the Frenkel–Kontorova model is studied in this paper, including the measure synchronization and the complete synchronization of the model. The measure synchronization depends not only on the coupling strength but also on the initial conditions. In a certain range of initial conditions, complete synchronization is reached when the system is in the measure synchronization, which means that as the coupling strength increases the energy can be transferred from one particle to another more easily. In other words, the average vibration amplitude of two particles tends to be identical as the coupling strength increases. The critical point K c depends on both the initial total energy of two particles and the initial energy difference between two particles. Moreover, it is also related to the initial velocity directions of the two particles.}

abstract ={We study the formation of the spiral structure of barred spiral galaxies, using an N-body model. The evolution of this N-body model in the adiabatic approximation maintains a strong spiral pattern for more than 10 bar rotations. We find that this longevity of the spiral arms is mainly due to the phenomenon of stickiness of chaotic orbits close to the unstable asymptotic manifolds originated from the main unstable periodic orbits, both inside and outside corotation. The stickiness along the manifolds corresponding to different energy levels supports parts of the spiral structure. The loci of the disc velocity minima (where the particles spend most of their time, in the configuration space) reveal the density maxima and therefore the main morphological structures of the system. We study the relation of these loci with those of the apocentres and pericentres at different energy levels. The diffusion of the sticky chaotic orbits outwards is slow and depends on the initial conditions and the corresponding Jacobi constant.},

abstract ={We develop an analytical theory of chaotic spiral arms in galaxies. This is based on the Moser theory of invariant manifolds around unstable periodic orbits. We apply this theory to the chaotic spiral arms, which start from the neighbourhood of the Lagrangian points L1 and L2 at the end of the bar in a barred-spiral galaxy. The series representing the invariant manifolds starting at the Lagrangian points L1, L2, or unstable periodic orbits around L1 and L2, yield spiral patterns in the configuration space. These series converge in a domain around every Lagrangian point, called ?Moser domain?, and represent the orbits that constitute the chaotic spiral arms. In fact, these orbits are not only along the invariant manifolds, but also in a domain surrounding the invariant manifolds. We show further that orbits starting outside the Moser domain but close to it converge to the boundary of the Moser domain, which acts as an attractor. These orbits stay for a long time close to the spiral arms before escaping to infinity.},

    still unknown. We investigate trapped orbits of a generic 4D symplectic 
    map in phase space and frequency space and find that, in contrast to 2D 
    maps, the trapping is i) not due to a hierarchy in phase space. Instead, 
    it occurs at the surface of the regular region, ii) outside of the Arnold 
    web. The chaotic dynamics in this sticky region is iii) dominated by 
    resonance channels which reach far into the chaotic region: We observe 
    iii.a) clear signatures of some kind of partial transport barriers and 
    conjecture iii.b) a stochastic process with an effective drift along 
    resonance channels. These two processes lay the basis for a future 
    understanding of the mechanism of power-law trapping in higher-dimensional 
    systems.}

abstract="Synchrony is one of the most common dynamical states emerging on networks. The speed ofconvergence towards synchrony provides a fundamental collective time scale forsynchronizing systems. Here we study the asymptotic synchronization times for directednetworks with topologies ranging from completely ordered, grid-like, to completelydisordered, random, including intermediate, partially disordered topologies. We extend theapproach of master stability functions to quantify synchronization times. We find that thesynchronization times strongly and systematically depend on the network topology. Inparticular, at fixed in-degree, stronger topological randomness induces fastersynchronization, whereas at fixed path length, synchronization is slowest for intermediaterandomness in the small-world regime. Randomly rewiring real-world neural, social andtransport networks confirms this picture.",

We show that the dynamics of coupled Duffing Hamiltonians exhibit a transition to coherent invariant measure, their orbits sharing the same phase space as the coupling strength is increased. Transitions from QP measure desynchronous to QP MS state and QP measure desynchronous to chaotic measure synchronous (CMS) state were both identified. Moreover, a transition from partial measure synchronization state to complete CMS state was found for three coupled subsystems.}
